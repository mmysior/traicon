"""
This module contains essential data resources for the AI TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) system.

The module includes:
- A contradiction matrix in CSV format, which is a fundamental tool in TRIZ for identifying inventive principles.
- A list of standard parameter names in TXT format, used for categorizing and analyzing technical systems.

These resources are crucial for:
1. Analyzing technical contradictions
2. Identifying relevant inventive principles
3. Standardizing parameter nomenclature across the AI TRIZ system

The data in this module serves as a foundation for various TRIZ-based problem-solving techniques
and analyses implemented throughout the AI TRIZ package.

Note: This module does not contain executable code but rather serves as a container for data files
that are utilized by other components of the AI TRIZ system.
